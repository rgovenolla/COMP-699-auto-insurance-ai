## AI Powered  Insurance Liability Assessment System

Policyholders can interact with an AI system by submitting questions or hypothetical scenarios related to liability risks, such as accidents, property damage, or legal claims. The system evaluates the potential impact of these scenarios on coverage, premiums, and liability exposure, providing personalized risk mitigation strategies based on the policyholder's profile and historical claims data.
